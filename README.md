# EasyDapp

This repo is created to show interaction between Ethereum blockchain and front end using simple HTML and plain Javascript.

## Motivation

The reason I created this repository is because a lot of tutorials in the internet use NodeJS/Golang/Phyton when in fact you actually can use plain Javascript to connect to Ethereum network.

## Usage

1. Open [Remix IDE.](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
2. Copy content of contract.sol to Remix.
3. Select solidity compiler as same as shown in the contract file.
4. Click compile.
5. Click on run tab, click deploy. Make sure that you have unlocked Metamask.
6. Once contract is deployed, you can see the list of methods in 'Deployed contracts' section.
